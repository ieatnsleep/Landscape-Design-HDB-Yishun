# Landscape Design work on Yishun Avenue

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This project explores 

## Skills Demonstrated:

### User-Centric Design Approach:
In landscape design, I aim to understand the needs and behaviors of the people (users) who will occupy the space, therefore designing the environment based on this requirement.

### Spatial & Information Architecture:
With proper Spatial diagram design the circulation of the user, the plants, pathways and focal points are designed in a cohesive layout to ensure a smooth navigation and balanced design.

### Iterative Design Process:
Multiple sketches, diagrams were done before finalizing the plan, this is similar to wireframing and prototyping.

### Technical Tools & Drafting Skills
I utilized tools such as AutoCAD, SketchUp, and Adobe Photoshop to create precise layouts and illustrations.

### Attention to Detail & Documentation
In this project, I maintained clear documentation of plant species, materials, and design rationale.
